## Planned updates
- [ ] Messaging Feature
- [ ] Favorite and Bookmark features
- [ ] Search Feature
- [ ] More unit testing
- [ ] Upload user photo when you signup
- [ ] Cropping photos feature when you create a new post
- [ ] User avatars
- [ ] Minor style tweaks: Picture cropping/resizing, cleaning up CSS id/class naming
- [ ] Some modal transitions are limited by Bootstrap's Modal options, for example, leaving a comment currently takes you back to index, when it should just add the comment and leave the modal open. Still figuring out the best workaround for this.
- [ ] Sorting options/logic for home feed
